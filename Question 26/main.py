### i feel its best to illustrate it with some code
### suppose cat is your class and you want to make an object named garfield
### The init method for cat has the arguments that can be passed "color" "weight and "likes
### to make garfield the program will look something like this

garfield= cat("orange","50 lbs","lasagna")

### we created garfield by calling the class cat and giving it the arguments it needs
### the answer is "call the name of the class with the arguments you would pass to the init method
